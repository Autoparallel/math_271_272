\textcolor{red}{Do a lot more with parameterization, surface, and normals and stuff!}

\begin{problem}
Consider $f(x,y)= 3x^4+x^3-18x^2y^2-3xy^2+3y^4$.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Show $\Delta f = 0$.
    \item Find the surface normal to the graph of $f$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Parameterize the following either implicitly or explicitly. In Cartesian coordinates, find the parameterization of the normal vector as well.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item The plane perpendicular to the vector $\vecv = \xhat + \yhat + \zhat$ passing through the point $(1,1,1)$.
	\item The upper half of the unit disk in the $xy$-plane.
	\item The surface of the unit sphere in $\R^3$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
Consider the following vector field
\[
\vecfieldE(x,y,z) = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{x}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}} \\ \frac{y}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}} \\ \frac{z}{(x^2+y^2+z^2)^{3/2}} \end{pmatrix},
\]
which models the electric field of a proton (in units of of charge $q=1$) placed at the origin.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Show that $\vecfieldE(x,y,z) = - \grad \phi(x,y,z)$ where $\phi(x,y,z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}}$.  We refer to $\phi(x,y,z)$ as the electrostatic potential (or voltage).
	\item Let $\Omega$ be a box with side lengths two centered at the origin.  Compute the total flux of $\vecfieldE$ through the surface of the box $\Sigma$. That is,
	\[
	\int_\Sigma \vecfieldE \cdot \unitvec d\Sigma.
	\]
	\item Using the provided argument, one can compute
	\[
	\int_\Omega \grad \cdot \vecfieldE d\Omega.
	\]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Compute $\grad \cdot \vecfieldE$ and note that this is zero everywhere except at $(x,y,z)=(0,0,0)$.
		\item Note that the two integrals in this problem are equal. This is known as the \emph{divergence theorem} and it is a special case of a more general theorem called \emph{Stokes' theorem} which generalizes the fundamental theorem of calculus. Is it true that $\grad \cdot \vecfieldE = 0$ everywhere?
	\end{itemize}
	\item Does the total flux depend on the size or shape of the box?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
