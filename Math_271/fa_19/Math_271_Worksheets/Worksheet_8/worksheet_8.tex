\begin{problem}
Multiply matrices.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Solve systems of equations using row reduction
\end{problem}

\begin{problem} Consider the matrix 
\[
A= \begin{bmatrix}
3 & 0\\
0 & -3
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Compute $\det(A-\lambda I)$.
    \item Find the solutions $\lambda$ for $\det(A-\lambda I)=0$.  These are your eigenvalues.
    \item Solve 
    \[
    (A-\lambda_1)\mathbf{v}_1=\mathbf{0}
    \]
    where $\lambda_1$ is your first eigenvalue. This will give you the corresponding eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_1$.
    \item Solve 
    \[
    (A-\lambda_2)\mathbf{v}_2=\mathbf{0}
    \]
    where $\lambda_2$ is your first eigenvalue. This will give you the corresponding eigenvector $\mathbf{v}_2$.
    \item Do you notice anything about the eigenvalues and the matrix $A$? What about the $\det(A)$ and the eigenvalues?
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Consider the matrix
\[
A=\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 5\\
5 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
Repeat the process given in Problem 1 to determine the two eigenvalues and eigenvectors for $A$.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Consider the matrix 
\[
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -1\\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
What happens when we try to find
\[
\det(A-\lambda I)=0? 
\]
How must we resolve this issue?
\end{problem}
