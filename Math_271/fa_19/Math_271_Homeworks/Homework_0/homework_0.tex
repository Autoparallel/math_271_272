    \textbf{Tell me a little bit about yourself!}
\end{center}

\begin{question}
    Where did you grow up? Why did you choose Colorado State University?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
    What is something interesting about yourself.  What is a favorite hobby of yours?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
    Why are you interested in chemistry? Do you have plans after you earn your degree?
\end{question}

\begin{question}
    Honest answers appreciated here.  Do you enjoy mathematics? Do you think it's hard? What do you hope to gain from this course?
\end{question}


\begin{center}
    \textbf{Now for some mathematics.}

\begin{problem}
    Compute the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $\displaystyle{\frac{d}{dx}(2x^7-3x^4+7)}$;
    \item $\displaystyle{\frac{d}{dt}\left(e^{at}\sin(bt)\right)}$;
    \item $\displaystyle{\frac{d}{ds}\left(\tan\left( e^{s^2}\right)\right)}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Compute the following:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $\displaystyle{\int 2x^7-3x^4+7dx}$;
    \item $\displaystyle{\int_{-1}^1 \cos(t) dt}$;
    \item $\displaystyle{\int_0^1 e^{2y}dy}$;
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Find the point(s) of intersection of the parabola $f(x)=2x^2+2x+2$ and the line $g(x)=4x+4$. Draw a picture and identify what's happening. (You can plot this on Desmos and print that out if you'd like, but do the algebra to find the solution by hand.)
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
    Now take the same parabola $f(x)=2x^2+2x+2$ and the line $h(x)=4x-4$. Draw a picture to show that these parabolas do not intersect. We can find ``complex intersections" by doing the same algebra as the previous problem. Find these complex interesctions. (\emph{Hint: set up an equation whose roots would give you the intersections of these two curves.)}
\end{problem}
