\begin{problem}
    Look up how to do \emph{integration by parts}. Use this technique to compute the integral
    \[
        \int t e^{3t}dt.
    \]
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Convert the following numbers in Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates and compute all pairwise products.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item $z_1=\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2}i$;
    \item $z_2=-1+3i$;
    \item $z_3=-2-3i$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{problem}
Find the square roots of $-i$ using a geometrical argument.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
Draw the unit circle in the complex plane. Plot the complex numbers $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$ given above and find their inverses. Explain what taking the inverse does geometrically.
\end{problem}
